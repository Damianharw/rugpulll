      <h2>What is Rug Pulling?</h2>
      <p>
        A rug pull is a type of scam in the cryptocurrency world where
        developers abandon a project and run away with investors' funds. Rug
        pulls often happen in decentralized finance (DeFi) and memecoins, where
        liquidity is key.

        <h2>Types of Rug Pulls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Liquidity Withdrawal:</strong> Developers remove liquidity,
            crashing the token price.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Team Token Dumping:</strong> Developers keep a large
            allocation of tokens and sell them suddenly, causing the token price
            to crash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Honeypot Scams:</strong> Prevent users from selling after
            they buy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stealth Rug Pulls:</strong> Gradual removal of liquidity
            over time to avoid immediate detection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wallet Draining Tokens:</strong> Malicious tokens that, when
            interacted with, drain cryptocurrency from users' wallets.

          <li>Check if the liquidity is locked.</li>
          <li>
            Check if the project has a website, active Telegram, or Twitter.
            Scams often lack proper social media
          </li>
          <li>Analyze the smart contract for suspicious code.</li>
          <li>Research the team and their track record.</li>
          <li>
            Ensure the project's liquidity pool is locked for a significant
            period to prevent developers from withdrawing funds.

          <h2>Exhibit A - The CONAN ($HERO)</h2>
          <p>
            One of the ways to increase the odds of your rugpull being
            succesfull is to use expected coin releases. In the early days of
            VSC, Conan was one of them. As time was coming closer and closer to
            the release of this coin, you could use the VSC explorer to see new
            coins with name CONAN (HERO) being released. At the time, the
            contract address of the upcoming coin was not known. Considering how
            much hype was build shortly before the release, people were ready to
            put their VSG into this coin the instant it was released.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, naturally, when a coin named the same went out, people wanted to
            get ahead and be first to buy them, only to find out, this was a
            copycat created by person with malicious intent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shortly after, any copycat that gained traction had liquidity pulled
            out before you blinked.
